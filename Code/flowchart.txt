1. Importing the packages
2. exploring the dataset - Melanoma classification database 
3. Image processing - based on image data augmentation and segmentation using keras
4. Splitting the data to train and test
5. building the model
	- Google InceptionV3
	- VGG16
	- VGG19
	- Mobilenet
	- Inception Resnetv2
	- Alexnet
	- Densenet
	- Ensemble method 
	- SVM with CNN
    
6.training the model
7.building the model of highest accuracy of 87% using SVM with CNN layers 
8. Flask Framework as cloud platform with Sqlite for signup and signin
9. User gives input
10. the given input preprocessed and with pretrained model is used fo segmenting the 
image
11. the segmented image is then used for prediction using trained model
12. final outcome is displayed through cloud in frontend 

Note:
Extension - The proposed model of melanoma detection are SVM + CNN, Google Inception, VGG, AlexNet which got around 87, 86, 58%
respectively where the ensemble method, mobilenet, inception resnet , Densenet are the extension models got 76,78,79,82%, from 
this we choose SVM + CNN for building the models

In the base paper dataset is mentioned to use ISIC Skin data which has around 10-110GB size so we taken sample images of around 
1.5gb and splited for training and segmenting which is available in kaggle sites
